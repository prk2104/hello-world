Guide to set of Repositories in this Github Location

This is a GitHub site for dsiplaying the various projects that I have worked on.  Over time, they will be indexed in this readme by software platform and Python or R library (for example Python, Scikitlearn), if applicable, by industry (for example, Bike Sharing), by subfield of data science (for example, machine learning, decision trees) and by step in data science pipeline (for example data cleaning).
